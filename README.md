Can the source code logic structure be browsed clearly? This software can do!
Can the common text can be run like a software? This software can do!

It's on pyqt5 platform, with the basic function of the previous program "Mindway" which is developed by C and glade2 for GTK, however, the interface of Mindway project is planed  to be improved, the pyqt5 gave the new chance.
I've planed to creat a omnipotent widget which can be called by a simple word, this have been introduced and put into practice by "Mindway" project which can easily call and run a dialogue  by the form with "@", then a assembled dialogue of lineedit, listview will get the input for the running of program like form, although there are no machine language except digital paragraph .
"MWdock"ã€€project is a addition, which give the interface outline, although  is still much big than object for understanding the purpose.
